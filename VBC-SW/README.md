As of right now, only the dev branch of simpleFOC (included in this folder) works with the latest ESP32 v3 for Arduino IDE. The other option is to use Dagor's modified library (2.3.3) with ESP32 v2 for Arduino IDE. For now we go with the latter.

Install the library by using the Include Library/Add .ZIP Library.
